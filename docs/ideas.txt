# Ideas / Feature brainstorming

Want the ability to be able to 'group' multiple repos. by Site_URL and have them show up as one entry.
    ex:
        "groups": {
            "electronicsProjects": [
                "https://github.com/asjs",
                "https://github.com/asadasd"
            ]
        }

This would generate one 'tile' on the finished site named 'electronicsProjects' and all of the repos would show up
under it.
